""" tkVideo: Python module for playing videos (without sound) inside tkinter Label widget using Pillow and imageio
This library is a modification on the tkVideo library provided by Xenofon Konitsas (Copyright Â© 2020 Xenofon Konitsas <konitsasx@gmail.com>)
Originally Released under the terms of the MIT license (https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) as described in LICENSE.md

To make the library work under required condition, a new class had to be made to call the playertask class into.
The original library could start a video, but not stop it. The new class has been made to start and stop a tread that plays the video.
This makes the class capable to restart a new video instead.
